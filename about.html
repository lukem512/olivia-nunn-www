          <h1>About Me</h1>

          <p><span class="emph">I love Bristol</span> and decided to stay there for many years after graduating from university. I continued to teach the piano, expanding from 4 or 5 students I'd taken on alongside my university studies to about <span class="emph">30 students</span> during my busiest period of teaching. In Bristol Iâ€™ve been involved with many other projects and areas of work, helping to run a kids play cafe and kids birthday parties, and completing a care qualification to work as a support worker at a farm providing day care and jobs for adults with learning disabilities. I also <span class="emph">sang and played the accordion</span> with some good friends in a folk band called <span class="emph">Hands of the Heron</span> and <span class="emph">played piano for the Bristol Hippodrome community choir</span>, run by the talented Victoria Bourne (Husky Tones).</p>

          <p>During my free time I love looking after vegetables and herbs in the garden, getting crafty with recycled materials, cycling, yoga, cooking, reading, travelling and exploring.</p>

          <p>I now find myself in <span class="emph">Cambridge</span> (although I still visit Bristol frequently) having spent 18 months I travelling around Asia with my partner, volunteering at many projects centered around sustainable farming. We intend to begin our own project in the UK, and are in the process of completing permaculture design and bee keeping courses. I hope to always continue teaching alongside this exciting venture.</p>

          <h2>University</h2>

          <p>I received a place to study music at the <span class="emph">University of Bristol</span> and spent a wonderful 3 years learning piano performance and accompanying with Raymond Clarke, alongside music history, harmony, composing and conducting classes. I often <span class="emph">accompanied opera society rehearsals</span> and university recitals, was the <span class="emph">rehearsal pianist for the Choral Society</span> led by head of music, John Pickard, and <span class="emph">sang with Schola Cantorum</span>, a beautiful medieval, female voices choir run by the fantastic Emma Hornby, who tutored me through my miraculously successful final dissertation.</p>

          <h2>Childhood</h2>

          <p>Since a very young age I loved to play the piano and sing, taking lessons, participating in school concerts and competitions in my hometown, Godalming. I <span class="emph">enjoyed playing for the annual school musicals</span> and participating in my secondary school jazz band where my wonderfully ambitious music teacher pushed us to a professional standard and gave us the opportunity to earn some pocket money <span class="emph">performing at parties and weddings</span>. For 4 years <span class="emph">I sang with the Guildford cathedral choir</span> and later <span class="emph">received a music scholarship to study at Charterhouse school</span> for my sixth form education.</p>

          <p>At Charterhouse I was able to sing in <span class="emph">5 high standard choirs</span>, complete my <span class="emph">piano ABRSM diploma</span>, try my hand at the bassoon and study music, history and mathematics for my Cambridge Pre-U exams (A-level equivalent). I was very fortunate to learn from an extremely supportive and challenging piano teacher, Rosemary Dines, and music director, Mark Shepherd, who hugely influenced my musical training. During the holidays I also worked at summer schools held at Charterhouse, hosting children from China and Hong Kong for several weeks of lessons, outdoor activities and cultural day trips.</p>
