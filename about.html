          <h1>About Me</h1>

          <p>I've been playing the piano since the age of six and, since then, have pursued a career in music. As a child and a teenager I completed grades 1 through 8 for the piano and eventually went on to complete a <span class="emph">piano diploma</span> whilst studying at Charterhouse, a school place for which I <span class="emph">won a scholarship</span> based on my musical endeavours. I studied music at the <span class="emph">University of Bristol</span> and, after falling in love with the city, decided to stay there as a piano teacher. I also <span class="emph">sing</span> and <span class="emph">play the accordion</span> for a folk band, Hands of the Heron, and have supported several orchestras.</p>

          <p></p>

          </ul>

          <h2>History</h2>

          <p>I began playing piano at the age of 6 and never really stopped! I progressed through my ABRSM piano grades whilst at primary and secondary school in Godalming, Surrey, where I grew up, and regularly took part in the Godalming Music Festival competitions. As a child I enjoyed taking part in school plays (performing, making/mending costumes, or playing the piano in the band), attending theatre and dance club, ballet classes, craft activities, singing as part of the Guildford Cathedral Choir, and playing the piano in my secondary school jazz band. My first job, aged 14, was working in a dance shop, and I began with my first piano student at around the same time. I also enjoyed babysitting for various neighbours and family friends.</p>
          <p>At the age of 16 I got a music scholarship and bursary to attend Charterhouse School for 6th form. I furthered my musical education there, helped by musical director, Mark Shepherd, and my incredible piano teacher, Rosemary Dines, amongst others. During my 2 years at Charterhouse I attempted to learn the bassoon, sang in 5 choirs (which included touring and recording CDs as well as regular rehearsals and chapel services), and completed my piano diploma and Cambridge Pre-Us (A-level equivalents) in music, maths and history. In the holidays I worked at summer camps held at Charterhouse, hosting children from China and Hong Kong for several weeks of lessons, outdoors activities and cultural day trips.</p>
          <p>In 2011 I moved to Bristol to do a music degree at the University of Bristol. I studied a range of topics including music history and research, composition, harmony, and performance. I studied solo classical piano performance with Raymond Clarke, who also gave me lots of accompanying tips which I put into practise accompanying friends recitals, chamber ensembles, opera society rehearsals/shows, and the university Choral Society, conducted by John Pickard, then the director of music at Bristol University. I taught piano alongside my studies, and worked as a waitress for a catering agency.</p>
          <p>I loved Bristol so much I decided to stay after graduating and now live in Easton with friends from university, working as a self employed piano teacher and accompanist. I teach 30 students in my local area, ranging from beginner to post grade 8 standard, aged 4 upwards. I accompany the Bristol Hippodrome Choir, run by local musician Victoria Bourne, and instrumental music exams. I love being creative in many ways and can often be found crocheting or making other crafts, often using ‘junk’ materials; playing the accordion and singing in a folk band called Hands of the Heron; looking after our vegetables and herbs in the garden; cycling; yoga; cooking; reading; drinking tea; travelling and exploring.</p>
