          <h1>About Me</h1>

          <p>I’m relatively new to Pembrokeshire</span> and looking forward to building a musical life here as well as exploring everything else this wonderful place has to offer! <span class="emph">Over the past 17 years I’ve taught in Pembrokeshire, Godalming, Bristol, Cambridge and Ebbw Vale.</span> I’ve always enjoyed other projects alongside my music career and have worked in care, hospitality, farming and continue to run an Etsy shop selling crochet crafts online. My partner and I are also setting up an agricultural and forestry business nearby.</p>

          <p>My musical work has included many years of teaching  totalling more than <span class="emph">50 students</span>. I’ve accompanied many instrumental recitals, exams and diplomas. I <span class="emph">sang and played the accordion</span> with some good friends in a Bristol folk band, Hands of the Heron, and accompanied the Bristol Hippodrome community choir, run by the talented Victoria Bourne (Husky Tones).</p>

          <p>During my free time I love growing, cooking and eating food, getting crafty, dysgu Cymraeg, practicing yoga, walking my dogs (Tyskie and Tiffin), playing board games, reading and exploring.</p>

          <h2>University</h2>

          <p>I spent 3 years studying music at the <span class="emph">University of Bristol</span>, learning piano performance and accompanying with Raymond Clarke, alongside music history, harmony, composing and conducting classes. I often <span class="emph">accompanied opera society rehearsals</span> and university recitals, was the <span class="emph">rehearsal pianist for the Choral Society</span> led by head of music, John Pickard, and <span class="emph">sang with Schola Cantorum</span>, a beautiful medieval, female voices choir run by the fantastic Emma Hornby, who tutored me through my miraculously successful final dissertation.</p>

          <p>It was alongside these studies that I began to teach in Bristol.</p>

          <h2>Childhood</h2>

          <p>Since a very young age I loved to play the piano and sing, taking lessons and participating in school concerts and competitions in my hometown, Godalming. I <span class="emph">enjoyed playing for the annual school musicals</span> and participating in my secondary school jazz band where my wonderfully ambitious music teacher pushed us to a professional standard and gave us the opportunity to earn some pocket money <span class="emph">performing at parties and weddings</span>. For 4 years <span class="emph">I sang with the Guildford cathedral choir</span> and later <span class="emph">received a music scholarship to study at Charterhouse school</span> for my sixth form education.</p>

          <p>At Charterhouse I was able to sing in <span class="emph">5 exeptional choirs</span>, complete my <span class="emph">piano ABRSM diploma</span>, try my hand at the bassoon and study music, history and mathematics for my Cambridge Pre-U exams (A-level equivalent). I was very fortunate to learn from an extremely supportive and challenging piano teacher, Rosemary Dines, and music director, Mark Shepherd, who hugely influenced my musical training. During the holidays I also worked at summer schools held at Charterhouse, hosting children from China and Hong Kong for several weeks of lessons, outdoor activities and cultural day trips.</p>
