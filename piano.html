          <h1>Piano Lessons</h1>
          <p>All lessons are calculated using an <span class="emph">hourly rate</span> of <span class="emph">£34</span>. This figure is recommended by the <a href="https://www.musiciansunion.org.uk/Home/Advice/Education/Getting-Paid/Rates" target="_blank">Musicians' Union.</a> See <a class="emph" href="#prices">below</a> for a complete <span class="emph">price list</span>.</p>

          <h2>Teaching Style</h2>
          <p>I have a passion for <span class="emph">student-led learning</span> and, therefore, tailor my lessons to each individual according to their needs and aspirations. Many of my students chose to progress through the <span class="emph">ABRSM or Trinity exams</span> (the two main exam boards for instrumental examinations), but many prefer to work on their own repertoire choices which may include <span class="emph">classical pieces, popular songs, film scores and Disney tunes!</span></p>

          <p>Some students are keen composers and we can work on <span class="emph">notation skills</span> allowing them to write down their own work. I also incorporate <span class="emph">music theory</span> with practical piano encouraging a deeper, more logical understanding of the music and giving students knowledge which can be transferred to another instrument or musical practise. I will always do everything in my power to find or make the resources necessary for the best tuition of each student.</p>

          <h2>Music Theory</h2>

          <p>Separate <span class="emph">music theory tuition</span> is also available and I can help students prepare for music theory examinations. Often this is <span class="emph">most applicable to students working towards higher level ABRSM instrumental or singing exams</span> as ABRSM requires a pass at grade 5 music theory before being able to take any exam beyond grade 5.</p>

          <h2>Timings</h2>
          <p>I am available for lessons within term times and often also during the holidays, regular or otherwise. Please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> for more information.

          <h2>Location</h2>
          <p>I am available for lessons in <span class="emph">Cambridge</span> and in <span class="emph">Bristol</span>. I usually teach at my students' houses although <span class="emph">I can also teach at my home</span> if that is preferred or a piano required. I usually <span class="emph">travel by bicycle to my students' houses</span>  and this may incur an additional charge depending on how far I’d need to travel.</p>

          <h2 id="prices">Prices</h2>
          <p>All prices are calculated using an hourly rate of £34. This figure is <span class="emph">recommended by the Musicians' Union</span>.</p>

          <h2>Student Concerts</h2>
          <p>Often, at the end of the summer and winter terms, I will organise a <span class="emph">piano concert</span> for my students. Taking part is <span class="emph">not compulsory</span> but I encourage all of my students to prepare a piece to perform. <span class="emph">Families and friends are invited</span>, some also perform and concerts are by no means limited to piano, and we spend a fun and informal afternoon hearing everyone’s performances and enjoying some <span class="emph">food and drinks</span> together afterwards!</p>
