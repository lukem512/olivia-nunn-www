      <h1 class="title">Piano Lessons</h1>
      <p>All lessons are calculated from my <strong>hourly rate, £33.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>20 mins</strong> (£11) recommended for young beginners (aged 4-7).</p>
      <p><strong>30 mins</strong> (£16.50) for students aged 8 or over, students who have had over a year of lessons, or anyone working towards grade 1-4.</p>
      <p><strong>45 mins</strong> (£24.75) for students working towards grade 5-7.</p>
      <p><strong>60 mins</strong> (£33) for students working towards grade 8.<p/>
      <p>I strongly believe in <strong>student-led learning,</strong> so tailor my lessons to each individual depending on what their needs and aspirations are. I take some of my students through the <strong>ABRSM or Trinity exams,</strong> or just work on repertoire including classical pieces, popular songs or Disney tunes! I have also worked on <strong>notation</strong> with students who are keen to write down their own compositions. I always find or make the resources necessary for the best tuition of each student.</p>
      <p>I travel by bicycle to most of my students houses after school hours, or teach some adult students in my home during the day.</p>
      <p><strong>Music theory</strong> tuition is also available. I incorporate some theory into piano lessons anyway as I believe it significantly aids understanding of piano technique and reading music. I can also prepare students wanting to take a music theory exam. Often this is most applicable to students working towards an ABRSM instrumental exam (piano or any other instrument, including singing) grade 6 or higher, as this is an ABRSM requirement</p>
      <p>Mostly I teach during the school term times but can sometimes be available for lessons during the holidays as well.</p>
      <p>At the end of each Christmas and summer term I organise a <strong>piano concert,</strong> for which I encourage all of my students to prepare a piece to perform. Students families and friends are invited and we spend a fun and informal aftertoon hearing everyone’s performances and enjoying some food and drinks together afterwards!</p>
