          <h1>Piano Lessons</h1>
          <p>All lessons are calculated using an <span class="emph">hourly rate</span> of <span class="emph">£34</span>. This figure is recommended by the <a href="https://www.musiciansunion.org.uk/Home/Advice/Education/Getting-Paid/Rates" target="_blank">Musicians' Union.</a> See <a class="emph" href="#prices">below</a> for a complete <span class="emph">price list</span>.</p>

          <h2>Teaching Style</h2>
          <p>I strongly believe in <span class="emph">student-led learning</span> and tailor my lessons to each individual, depending on their needs and aspirations. I take many of my students through the <span class="emph">ABRSM or Trinity exams</span>, but some just work on their repertoire including classical pieces, popular songs and even Disney tunes! I have also worked on <span class="emph">notation</span> with students who are keen to write down their own compositions. I always find or make the resources necessary for the best tuition of each student.</p>
          <p>Seperate <span class="emph">music theory</span> tuition is also available. I incorporate some theory into piano lessons anyway as I believe it significantly aids understanding of piano technique and reading music. I can also prepare students wanting to take a music theory exam. Often this is most applicable to students working towards an ABRSM instrumental exam (piano or any other instrument, including singing) grade 6 or higher, as this is an ABRSM requirement.</p>
          <p>I am available for lessons within term times and often outside of these. Please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> for more information.

          <h2>Location</h2>
          <p>I am available for lessons in <span class="emph">Bristol</span> and in <span class="emph">Cambridge</span>. I usually teach at my students' houses although I can also teach at my home if that is preferred or a piano required. I usually travel by bicycle to my students' houses.

          <h2>Student Concerts</h2>
          <p>I often organise a <span class="emph">piano concert</span> at the end of the <span class="emph">Summer</span> and <span class="emph">Winter</span> terms, for which I encourage all of my students to prepare a piece to perform. Students families and friends are invited and we spend a fun and informal aftertoon hearing everyone’s performances and enjoying some food and drinks together afterwards!</p>
