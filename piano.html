          <h1>Lessons</h1>

          <h2>Teaching Style</h2>
          <p>I have a firm belief in <span class="emph">student-led learning</span> and, therefore, tailor my lessons to each individual according to their needs and aspirations. Many of my students chose to progress through the <span class="emph">ABRSM or Trinity exams</span> (the two main exam boards for instrumental examinations), but others prefer to work on their own repertoire choices which may include <span class="emph">classical pieces, pop songs, film scores and Disney tunes!</span></p>

          <p>Some students are keen composers and we can work on <span class="emph">notation skills</span> allowing them to write down their own work. I also incorporate <span class="emph">music theory</span> with practical piano skills encouraging a deeper, more logical understanding of the music and giving students knowledge which can be transferred to another instrument or musical practice. I’m very happy guiding you down whichever path you chose and helping you decide if you’re not sure. I will always do everything in my power to find or make the resources necessary for the best tuition of each student.</p>

          <h2>Music Theory</h2>

          <p>Separate <span class="emph">music theory tuition</span> is also available and I can help students prepare for music theory examinations. Often this is <span class="emph">most applicable to students working towards higher level ABRSM instrumental or singing exams</span> as ABRSM requires a pass at grade 5 music theory before being able to take any exam beyond grade 5, but it is an option open to anyone.</p>

          <p>Group music theory sessions are also available given enough interest. Please get in touch to discuss details regarding this.</p>

          <h2>Timings</h2>
          <p>I usually teach throughout the school terms and often also during the holidays, depending on availability. I try to keep my teaching <span class="emph">Monday - Thursday</span> but depending on individual situations other arrangements may be possible.</p>

          <p>I love to teach regular, weekly lessons as it encourages a strong bond between teacher and student and allows the student to learn and improve more steadily (with self-led practice at home, of course!). However, I understand this is not an option available to everybody and am very happy to teach one off or <i>ad hoc</i> lessons as well.</p>

          <h2>Location</h2>
          <p>I am available for lessons at my home in <span class="emph">Narberth</span>. If you’d like to learn but aren’t able to come to me I can travel, so please still <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>. Travelling to a lesson may incur an additional charge depending on how far I’d need to travel.</p>

          <h2 id="prices">Prices</h2>
          <p>All prices are calculated using an hourly rate of £30.</p>

          <p>I am willing to arrange concessions, if needed, on an individual basis, so please get in touch if you’d like to speak to me about that.</p>

          <h2>Student Concerts</h2>
          <p>Often, at the end of the summer and winter terms, I will organise a <span class="emph">piano concert</span> for my students. Taking part is <span class="emph">not compulsory</span> but I encourage all of my students to prepare a piece to perform. <span class="emph">Families and friends are invited</span>, some also perform and concerts are by no means limited to piano! We spend a fun and informal afternoon hearing everyone’s performances and enjoying some <span class="emph">food and drinks</span> together afterwards!</p>
